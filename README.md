## scraping content from a given URL 
storing it in a database using SQLAlchemy, within the context of a FastAPI application. It incorporates the following key functionalities:

## **URL Scraping**: 

- Extracts content from a specified URL using the requests library.
- Cleans the extracted content by removing scripts and styles (if desired).
## **SQLAlchemy Integration**:

- Creates a database engine and defines a SQLAlchemy model to represent the scraped data.
- Creates a database table based on the model.
- Uses a database session to add and commit scraped content to the database.
## **FastAPI Endpoint**:

- Exposes a POST endpoint (/process_url) that accepts a URL as input.
- Processes the URL, scrapes the content, and stores it in the database.
- Returns a response with a unique chat ID and a success message.
## **Error Handling**:

- Implements basic error handling for HTTP requests and database operations.
